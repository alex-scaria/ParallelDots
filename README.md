Smart Shelf -- AI based shelf monitoring**


This model can be used for smart retail shopes.
On a **customers perspective** we can reshape our retail sector where customers can pick the item 
and instantly price will be added to their digital wallet and if they put the item back to the shelf that

This will drastically improve the customer experience.
